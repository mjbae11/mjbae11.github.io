Geo coded map of high crime rate districts around Seattle. An analysis of Seattle's crime prone areas.


## Why is this important to map?
Those that reside or arriving into Seattle deserve safety in the ares they live in. However, there are not a lot of resources that easily portray crime statistics and the types of crime. A user-friendly, easily accessible API is needed for those that want to reduce their risk in being a victim to crime. 

## What kind of data will I be using?
Seattle PD keeps up to date data on the types of crime and police activity. It records every instance of a crime that happens in Seattle for the goal of transparency of authoritative organizations such as the Police. This data will asily portray the safety of Seattle once the API is complete.


## What attributes will I be recording?
This would depend on which data is readily available but I would like to focus on violent crimes. As these have the most impact on fear of safety, recording these types of data will prove useful to determining what are safe areas to live in. I addition to violent crimes I would also like to record shoplifting/petty crime data. Shoplifting data may prove useful for businesses focusing on risk prevention and the awareness of petty crime may reduce citizens chances of getting their car broken into for example.
